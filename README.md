Casual app for browsing or submitting images and adding humorous captions. It is a project 
application done for module 3 of Flatiron School. Besides smoothing up existing features, 
refactoring certain code blocks, and seeking out bugs, the main to-dos are:
  - add custom validation error messages
  - enable caption box scrolling from anywhere in window
  - create thumbnail view of images (stretch goal)
  - enable drag-and-drop image uploading (stretch goal)
